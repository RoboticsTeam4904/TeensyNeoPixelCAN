TeensyNeoPixelCAN
=================

This program controls NeoPxiel LED strips over CAN with a Teensy microcontroller.
It is currently designed for the Offseason 2015 robot, which has two strips with 34 LEDs each.
It will be compatible with the CustomNeoPixels library once it is finished.
It is designed to be controlled by setting mode, color, and progress through mode, rather than
setting individual LEDs. This reduces the required number of messages and exports more
processing to the Teensy.
